1089-134686-0007  A cold, lucid and different rainbow was thrown.
1089-134686-0012  Her eyes seemed to regard him with mild titties. Her holiness, the strange light growing faintly upon her straying flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who approached her.
1089-134686-0024  If the wine change into vinegar, if the host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated, is Jesus Christ still present under their speech as God and as man?
1089-134686-0031  Stephen's heart began to slowly fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.
1089-134686-0037  In the silence, their dark fire kindles the dusk into a torn glow.
1089-134691-0001  For a full hour he had paced up and down, waiting, but he could wait no longer.
1089-134691-0012  It was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that, if he ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and in beggar's weed, that they would be generous towards him.
1188-133604-0001  they unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as chiaroscurists
1188-133604-0003  My first intentional reason was that they enforced, beyond all resistance, on any student who might attempt to copy them, this method of learning portions of distinct hue side by side.
1188-133604-0004  Some of the types of meat were attacked as much water had been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge.
1188-133604-0009  Now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues, it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper, and that I am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all around it to ensure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly.
1188-133604-0014  Do not, therefore, think that the Gothic School is an easier one.
1188-133604-0016  This at once compels you to understand that your work is to be imaginative and decorative, that it represents beautiful things, in the clearest way, but not under existing conditions, and that, in fact, you are producing jewelers' work rather than pictures'.
1188-133604-0024  Nothing will be more precious to you, I think, than the practical study of art and the conviction which will force itself under one more reality. In the way all things are bound together, little and great, the spirit and the matter.
1188-133604-0027  Now here's Raphael, exactly between the two, trees still drawn leaf by leaf, wholly formal, the beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance.
1188-133604-0031  There's one and there's another. The Dudley and the Flint.
1188-133604-0040  The crampness and the poverty are all intended.
1188-133604-0041  It is a gleaner bringing down her one sheath of corn to an old watermill, itself mossy and rent, scarcely able to get its stones to time.
1188-133604-0042  The scene is absolutely Arcadian.
121-121726-0003  Hay fever. A heart trouble caused by falling in love with a grass widow.
121-121726-0005  Hedge. A fence.
121-121726-0011  Husband. The next thing to a wife.
121-123859-0000  you are my all the world and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue none else to me nor i to none alive that might steal the sense or changes right or wrong
121-127105-0001  Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following.
121-127105-0002  cried one of the women. He took no notice of her. He looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of.
121-127105-0004  The stories written.
121-127105-0007  To this, his answer was prompt. Oh, thank God, no. And is the record yours?
121-127105-0008  He hung fire again, a woman's.
121-127105-0014  You are a cat.
121-127105-0019  Mrs. Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more light.
121-127105-0024  Poor Douglas. Before his death, when it was in sight, committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days, and yet, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to read to our hush to the disciple for the night of the church.
121-127105-0028  The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations, and that his own affairs took up all his time.
121-127105-0029  There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority.
121-127105-0034  It sounded dull. It sounded strange. And all the more so because of his main condition, which was...
121-127105-0036  But was that all the reward? One of the ladies' answers.
1221-135766-0000  How strange it seemed to the sad boy, as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day on the throne, and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child.
1221-135766-0001  god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connect her parent forever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
1221-135766-0005  Hester could only account for the child's character, and even then most vaguely and imperfectly, by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period, while Pearl was abiding her soul through the spiritual world and her bodily frame during its interior of birth.
1221-135767-0004  We have spoken of Pearl's rich and luxuriant beauty, a beauty that's shown with deep and vivid tints, a bright complexion, eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow, and hair already of a deep, glossy brown, and which, in after years, would be nearly akin to black. Okay.
1221-135767-0013  Lifting the iron hammer and pounding the pool, Mr. Prynne gave a sentence which was answered by one of the governor's thoughts from his side, a freeborn Englishman, now a seven-year slave.
1221-135767-0022  but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence
1284-1180-0000  He wore blue silk stockings, blue knee pants with gold buckles, a blue ruffling waist, and a jacket of bright blue braided with gold.
1284-1180-0003  For a long time, the industry explored the beautiful land of ours in which they lived.
1284-1180-0009  Then they started on again, and two hours later came inside of the House of Dr. Lawrence.
1284-1180-0014  Ojo had never eaten such a fire in the middle of his life.
1284-1180-0018  It takes me several years to get this magic power, but this woman, I am pleased to say, is nearly done. You see, I'm making it for my good life now. She wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own.
1284-1180-0021  i think the next glass cat the magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and may prove of some use to us
1284-1180-0023  You see, I've lived all my life with Uncle Nunky, the Silent One, and there was no one to tell me anything.
1284-1180-0026  But first I will tell you that for many years I have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cook the meals and wash the dishes.
1284-1180-0030  For when she was brought to life, she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is, for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are.
1284-1181-0005  No, I forgot all about the brains, exclaimed the woman.
1284-1181-0006  and feel above her work
1284-1181-0007  She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.
1284-1181-0008  I think that will do it, to continue, for the other qualities are not needed in service.
1284-1181-0010  Their contents had all boiled away, leaving in the bottle of their kettle a few grains of fine white powder.
1284-1181-0011  Very carefully, the magician removed this powder, placing it all together in a golden dish, where he mixed it with a golden spoon.
1284-1181-0017  The Wizard of Oz, who used to be a humbug and knew no magic at all, has been taking lessons of Glinda, and I'm told he is getting to be a pretty good wizard, but he is nearly the assistant of the great sorceress.
1284-134647-0001  The Edict of Milan, the great charter of toleration, had confirmed to each individual of the Roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion.
1284-134647-0003 ...criminal obstinacy, and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation.
1284-134647-0004  Some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of Diocletian, and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression
1320-122612-0003  He often stopped to examine the fields, nor did he cross a river without attentively considering the quantity, the velocity, and the color of its waters.
1320-122612-0004  distressing his own judgement, his appeals to the opinion of Chingachgit were frequent and honest.
1320-122612-0012  Extinguished brands were lying around a spring. The offals of a deer were scattered about the place, and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses.
1320-122617-0001  In his return to the camp, his acute and practical intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a wildness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were immediately treated with his enemies.
1320-122617-0004  The ingenious Hawkeye, who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman, was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation.
1320-122617-0009  I greatly mourn that one so well-exposed should die of riddance, for I have sought a good in him. Can you lead me to him?
1320-122617-0018  It was silent in the game, being eaten at all, sold by the captain and likened by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of the fire.
1320-122617-0019  FUNCA SOCKETY THE DISCUSES AND REQUIDING ACTIONS BEING RIDGED AND BOUND, BOTH HANDS AND FEAT, BY STRONG AND END OF DISTANCE.
1320-122617-0020  The scout, who had left David at the door to ascertain they were not observed, thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy.
1320-122617-0028  But there are none who can say that I have ever forgotten my faith in the Lord, even in the greatest straits.
1320-122617-0032  Keep silent as lies may come, and it would be wise when it was useful to break out suddenly in all of your shoutings which would serve to remind the Indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be.
1580-141083-0003  Without his scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man.
1580-141083-0006  The only duplicate which existed so far as I knew was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister, a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion.
1580-141083-0009  The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers.
1580-141083-0013  Above all things, I desire to settle the matter firedly and discreetly.
1580-141083-0017  So it seems to me.
1580-141083-0042  My scholar has been left very poor, but he is hardworking and investors. He will come back.
1580-141083-0044  I dare not go so far as that, but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely.
1580-141083-0046  But I have occasionally done the same thing at other times.
1580-141084-0003  No names, please!
1580-141084-0010  I will take the black clay with me, also the pencil cuttings. Goodbye.
1580-141084-0017  No good, my dear Watson.
1580-141084-0034  Well, well. Don't trouble to answer. Listen and see that I do you no injustice.
1580-141084-0035  He could examine the papers in his own office.
1580-141084-0042  A sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs.
1580-141084-0044  He loves sitting there.
1580-141084-0048  It will be clear to you, from what I have said, that only you could have left to see me. Since you were left in the room, you must have locked the door when you went out.
1580-141084-0050  If Mr. Stone was sorry, would you give him a sec?
1995-1826-0000  In the debate between a single society, it's very specific to the North and the North, not only a little bit for the reason, but delivery for a man in the business.
1995-1826-0004  It might be something useful now.
1995-1826-0005  The killing is no society, just elementary work.
1995-1826-0009  You ought to know, John. If I teach Negroes, I'll scarcely see much of people in my own class.
1995-1826-0012  She wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms.
1995-1826-0015  She had almost forgotten that it was here within touch and sight.
1995-1826-0022  I suppose though it's too early for them. Then came the explosion.
1995-1826-0024  It's the golden fleece. It's the silver fleece. Be hugged.
1995-1836-0007  If you believe in some education, ask Mary Taylor.
1995-1836-0008  I believe in the training of people to their highest capacity. The Englishman here heartily seconded him.
1995-1837-0003  The revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder.
1995-1837-0010  Perhaps she too might be there, waiting, weeping.
1995-1837-0016  A one-one running across, stupid, a gay, with utter amazement. Your love isn't the best to treat.
1995-1837-0023  The net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her. She had struggled with dumb, speechless terror against another blasphemy which stole it in her life with gnarled and creeping fingers. But now at last, weakly, she opened her eyes and questioned.
2094-142345-0000  It is very final piece of red brick, softened by the color of white, which has dispersed itself with heavy irregularity, so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables, the windows, and the doorplace.
2094-142345-0005  several clothes horses, a pillion, a spinning wheel, and an old box wide open and stuffed full of colored rags.
2094-142345-0007  The history of the house is played now.
2094-142345-0011  Do not suppose, however, that Mrs. Poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance. She was a good-looking woman, not more than eight-and-thirty, of fair complexion and sandy hair, well-shapen, light-footed.
2094-142345-0023  You are a raider. I'm sitting down for your work. A little mile after it's time to hit mine.
2094-142345-0035  But not more than what's in the Bible, Aunt, said Dinah.
2094-142345-0036  Lady, you never heard me say about it. Are we going to say about it? Yes.
2094-142345-0039  I have strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children from anything I have done.
2094-142345-0043  By this time the two gentlemen had reached the pairing and had got down from their horses. It was plain they meant to come in.
2094-142345-0045  Oh sir, don't mention it.
2094-142345-0057  I know his farm is in better order than any other than 10 miles less. And as for the kitchen, I don't believe there's one in the kingdom to be there.
2300-131720-0005  If we allow the station to fall, it is a great economy to get it up to the city.
2300-131720-0008  Everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy, the contraction of space, the intensification of culture,
237-126133-0004  If she could only see Francie for just one moment.
237-126133-0005  Oh, she's always at the piano. She must be right now, somewhere. And then somebody laughs.
237-126133-0023  he cried in high dungeon, just as if he owned the whole of the peppers, and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy.
237-126133-0024  And the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of storms, having dipped a ladder, but occupied quite a stage of time.
237-134493-0000  It is 16 years since John Bergson died.
237-134493-0002  From the Norwegian graveyard, one looks out over a vast checkerboard, marked off in squares of wheat and corn, light and dark, dark and dark.
237-134493-0006  That's not much of a job for an athlete. Here I've been to town and back.
237-134493-0012  I guess that's my need when I go down to pick chairs.
237-134493-0018  There is even a white row of beehives in the orchard under the wall.
237-134500-0002  A brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky.
237-134500-0006  Just smell the wild roses. They are always so spicy after all.
237-134500-0018  He reached up among the branches, and began to pick the sweet, insipid root. Long ivory-coloured berries, tipped with faint peat like white coral, that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through.
237-134500-0029  I don't stand around at all.
237-134500-0038  And anyhow, there's nothing to understand.
237-134500-0040  I pray for you, but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself.
260-123286-0000  Saturday, August 15th. The sea unbroken all round. No land in sight.
260-123286-0009  I take this as my answer and I lead the professor to bite his breast with impatience.
260-123286-0016  These thoughts agitated me all day, and my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours of sleep.
260-123286-0025  Flight is out of the question, then. The reptiles rose. They wheeled around our mini-graph with a repeat greater than that of expressed things.
260-123288-0000  The Warrens become lost in the distance.
260-123288-0014  On Thursday night.
260-123288-0021  Mays rise to the heartburns.
260-123288-0022  They seem to be, we are lost, and I'm lost here.
260-123288-0024  All right.
260-123288-0026  We shall be blown out. But no. The dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside. It approaches Hans, who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily and threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knee and his head down to avoid it.
260-123440-0005  And yesterday, things went on just as usual.
260-123440-0007  I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
260-123440-0009  I shall never get to 20 at that rate.
260-123440-0011  No, I've made up my mind about it. If I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here.
260-123440-0014  And I declare it's too bad that it is.
260-123440-0019  cried Alice again, for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.
2830-3979-0000  We want you to help us publish some leading work of Luther's for the general American market. Will you do it?
2830-3980-0000  In every way, they sought to undermine the authority of St. Paul.
2830-3980-0001  They said to the Galatians,
2830-3980-0016  This spoils man's best work.
2830-3980-0017  When I was a young man, I thought Paul was making too much of his fault.
2830-3980-0021  and God the Father who raised him from the dead.
2830-3980-0023  These perverters of the righteousness of the Son persist the Father and the Son, and the works have been birthed.
2830-3980-0027  Thank you.
2830-3980-0032  We look for that reward which I have not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of the world.
2830-3980-0049  Embrace him, and forget about the nature of their life.
2830-3980-0054  That Christ, his very God, is apparent in that Christ God is speaking divine powers including with the Father, as Winston's power to dispense grace and peace.
2830-3980-0056  otherwise Paul should have written grace from God the Father and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ
2830-3980-0061  Not gold, or silver, or paschal lambs, or an angel, but himself. What for?
2961-960-0002  In the supposed depths of this dialogue, the Neoplatonists found hidden meanings in connections with the Jewish and Christian scriptures, and out of them, they elicited doctrines quite at variance with this period from later.
2961-960-0004  There is no danger of the modern commentators on the TVS falling into the absurdities of the middle-class lists.
2961-960-0005  In the present day, we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought.
2961-960-0015  The style and plan of the Timoniers differ greatly from that of any other of the Kotari rioters.
2961-960-0018  But in the rest of the work, the power of language seems to fail him, and the dramatic form is wholly given up.
2961-960-0019  but not in another. And the Greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena.
2961-961-0003  I will. It may have proved. I will.
2961-961-0010  But in Egypt, the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered forever in our temples.
2961-961-0014  9,000 years have lapsed since she found yours, and 8,000 years since she found ours, as our enemies report.
2961-961-0015  Many laws exist among us which are the counterparts of Jews as they were in the olden times.
2961-961-0017  Observe again what he cared a lot to in the pursuit of wisdom by searching out the deep things of the world and applying them to the use of manna.
2961-961-0022  Then now let me explain to you the order of a part of the world. First, Chris, who is a natural philosopher, will speak of the origin of the world, going down to the creation of men. Then I shall receive the men whom he has created, and some of whom will have been educated by you, and introduce them to you as the lost obedient citizens of whom the Egyptian records spoke.
3570-5694-0001  The utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth.
3570-5694-0005  Under the Purdue, certain victuals, and more particularly, certain beverages, are strictly reserved for the use of the Superior Christ.
3570-5694-0006  Strengthenness and the other pathological consequences of the free rules of springing therefore tend in their turn to become honorific, as being a mark at the secondary move of the security of the first story of the world of strength.
3570-5694-0007  It has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle.
3570-5694-0018  The heroes of unicorns and liberals may be left to the garden of the two classes, the three and the seven, with a lovely and the eastern vessel.
3570-5694-0019  But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.
3570-5695-0000  In a general way, though not wholly nor consistently, these two groups coincide.
3570-5695-0003  In the communities of the Western culture, this point is a present fire in the lower middle class.
3570-5695-0014  Among the country population, its places to some extent taken by saving from home conflicts known through the medium of northern gossip, sufficiently to serve the life of the general country of the funeral repute.
3570-5696-0001  But the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme. Leisure held the first place at the start and came to order ranks very much above spiritual consumption of wealth, both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi-peaceful culture.
3570-5696-0008  But it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterised as wasteful,
3575-170457-0001  Why are we to be denied each other's society?
3575-170457-0011  But it is not bringing you to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you consult your own happiness.
3575-170457-0012  You will say that a woman has no need of such a caution. There can be no peril in any of her.
3575-170457-0018  Sir. March 16th.
3575-170457-0022  In the evenings I can rest, I do think, but I never trouble anyone else with my thoughts.
3575-170457-0025  Again, I thank you. This incident, I suppose, will be renewed no more. If I live to be an old woman, I shall remember it thirty years hence as a bright dream.
3575-170457-0026  P.S. Pricer, excuse me for writing to you a second time. I cannot help writing, partly to tell you how thankful I am for your kindness, and partly to let you know that your advice shall not be wasted, however sorrowfully and reluctantly it may be at first swallowed. C.E.B.
3575-170457-0029  Your letter has given me great pleasure, and I should not forgive myself if I did not tell you so.
3575-170457-0032  Come, come, I'm getting really tired of your absence.
3575-170457-0044  After this disappointment, I never dare reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of the pleasure again. It seems as if some fatality stood between you and me.
3729-6852-0002  In order to please her, I spoke to her of the Abbey Conti, and I had occasion to quote two lines of that profound writer.
3729-6852-0013  "'You do me a great honor.'
3729-6852-0016  Madame Quincent, besides, can answer your inquiries.
3729-6852-0019  Thank you.
3729-6852-0022  I address him in Italian, and he answers very wittily, but his way of speaking makes me smile, and I tell him why.
3729-6852-0026  Yeah, but the meridian of the Calais Royale is the most advanced.
3729-6852-0029  It was soil everywhere. But for the last three peaks, nobody will use any smell for the bad soil. So that's what happened.
3729-6852-0031  But how did she manage to render it so fashionable?
3729-6852-0037  She introduced me to all her guests and gave me some particulars respecting every one of them.
3729-6852-0043  I reside in the Mafe, Blue Gipsy Court.
3729-6852-0045  He had a good appetite, could tell a good story without laughing, was celebrated for his witty repartees and his sociable manners, but he spent his life at home, seldom going out and seeing hardly anyone, because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least twenty cats with which he would amuse himself all day.
4077-13751-0000  On the 6th of April, 1830, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was formally organized and thus took on a legal emergency.
4077-13751-0001  Its origin was small, a germ, an insignificant seed, hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition.
4077-13754-0016  And so the story of Mormonism runs on. Its finale has not yet been written. The current press presents continuously new stages of its progress, new developments of its plan.
4446-2271-0018  She considered for a moment and then said, No, I think not, though I am glad you asked him.
4446-2271-0019  After that it was easy to forget, actually to forget.
4446-2271-0022  I'm glad she fell alone soon.
4446-2271-0023  After all, we were awfully young.
4446-2271-0024  I shouldn't be wondering if she could laugh about it
4446-2273-0001  They asked him to come to see them in Chelsea, and they spoke very tenderly of Hobart.
4446-2273-0012  Thank you, but I don't like it so well as this.
4446-2273-0013  Have you been in Paris much these late years?
4446-2273-0019  Come, we'll have our coffee in the other room and you can smoke.
4446-2273-0023  The strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both.
4446-2275-0009  I got in about 10 minutes ago.
4446-2275-0014  I can't stand seeing you miserable.
4446-2275-0017  But it's worse now. It's unbearable.
4446-2275-0019  The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can't get at it anymore.
4446-2275-0020  It was myself I was defying the weapon.
4446-2275-0028  Yes, yes, she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him.
4446-2275-0039  I must know about you.
4507-16021-0003  She has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.
4507-16021-0010  We have always thought that it was sometimes the greatest harm, and, at least, a simple and useful deed, worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted and fulfilled merits.
4507-16021-0012  Why should they park on the road?
4507-16021-0015  Since when has Maladie banished medicine?
4507-16021-0030  assuredly if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study
4507-16021-0031  And then we insist upon it. The study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out at the mutual remedy is not a business in which choice is permitted.
4507-16021-0036  Facts form one of these and ideas the other.
4507-16021-0037  There it clothes itself in word masks, in metaphor rags,
4507-16021-0051  In this world, evidently the vestibule of another, there are no fortunes.
4507-16021-0053  to diminish the number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous, that is, the object,
4507-16021-0058  The flame is the enemy of the ring.
4970-29093-0000  You'll never pick it out of the Astor Library.
4970-29093-0006  The law seemed to him well enough as a science, but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worthwhile to build law. In all the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the anteroom of the law office where he was writing, Philip invariably advised to settle, no matter how, but settle, greatly to the disgust of his employer, who knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes with the attendant fees.
4970-29095-0004  I heard father tell cousin Adler that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have the compensation for the debt now.
4970-29095-0006  Is thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world's people?
4970-29095-0011  Does Dee think Dee could stand in six months?
4970-29095-0015  If I can get patience...
4970-29095-0016  Ruth sat quite still for a time, with face intent and flushed. It was out now.
4970-29095-0023  I have nothing to wear, replied that demure person.
4970-29095-0031  He doesn't say exactly what it is, agreed a little easily, but it's something about land and railroads, and he knows, Father, that fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how in a new country.
4970-29095-0032  But Philip is honest and he has talent enough, if he will stop scribbling, to make his way.
4970-29095-0033  What a box women are put into, measured for it, and put in young. If we go anywhere, it's in a box, veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities.
4970-29095-0034  Why should I rest and be stupid and sit in an action because I am a girl?
4992-23283-0000  But the more forgetfulness he had been prevailed, the more powerful was the force of the human beings which he alone.
4992-23283-0001  Miss Milner's health is not good.
4992-23283-0004  And yet you must own your behavior as one for them. Has it not been in this particular incoherent or unaccompanic?
4992-23283-0008  He seemed to wait for her reply, but as she made none, he proceeded.
4992-23283-0009  Oh, my lord, cried Miss Woodley with a most forcible accent. You are the last person on earth who would pardon me for entrusting.
4992-23283-0012  independent of her fortune she has beauty to captivate the heart of any man and with all her follies she has a frankness in her manner an unaffected wisdom in her thoughts of the vastity of her conversation and with all the substance of her demeanour that might alone engage the affections of a man of the nicest sentiments and the strongest understanding
4992-41797-0010  Always irritable, cold, indifferent, he had grown rapidly more so as years went on.
4992-41797-0014  When she could not make a rabbit or a bird look real on paper, she searched in her father's books for pictures of its bones.
4992-41797-0017  He wouldn't search, so don't worry, he called Sarah Carter, and the two looked at each other and knew that it was so.
4992-41797-0020  Nancy's curly chestnut crop shone in the sun and Olive's thick black plates looked blacker by contrast.
4992-41797-0021  She is wonderful, more wonderful than anybody we've ever seen anywhere, and she draws better than the teacher in Charlestown.
4992-41806-0001  Tonight there was no need of extrovert, and there was great ceremony to be observed in lighting the fires on the hearth stands.
4992-41806-0007  Olive had peated the motto, and giving it to Mr. Copper, who stood by the fireside, got me deftly putting it into the place prepared for it.
4992-41806-0008  Olive has another lovely gift for the yellow house, said Mother Carrie, rising, and to carry out the next part of the program, we shall have to go in procession upstairs to the bedroom.
4992-41806-0011  Mother Carrie poured coffee, Nancy chocolate, and the others helped serve the sandwiches and cake, donuts, and tarts.
4992-41806-0013  Approaching the dining table, he carefully placed the article in the center and removed the clock.
5105-28233-0003  But it must be confessed that Servodak, being naturally idle, was very much given to spinning tops.
5105-28233-0008  When a private in the 8th Cavalry, he had been on the point of quitting the army at 28 years of age, but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to Captain Servetus.
5105-28240-0011  I left you on a continent, and here I have the honor of finding you on an island.
5105-28240-0013  Nothing more than you know yourself.
5105-28240-0015  For some moments, he seemed perfectly stupefied, and then recovering himself, he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions.
5105-28240-0022  It was on the last day of January that the repairs of the schooner were completed.
5105-28241-0006  The log and the compass their vision were able to be called upon to the world of the sexton which had become utterly useless.
5105-28241-0009  "'And what demonstration do you offer?' asked Servadak eagerly. "'That it will not happen.'
5105-28241-0011  all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis
5105-28241-0012  Is it not impossible, he murmured aloud, that any city should disappear so completely?
5105-28241-0015  And although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area, the differences of level were insignificant, not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the sight of the city between the Terrace and the Great Seats of Antioch.
5142-33396-0008  I painted the eyes red for anger.
5142-33396-0014  30 men, one after another, raise their hands and say,
5142-33396-0017  We ate at many men's tables uninvited.
5142-33396-0018  My dragon's belly is never full, and on board went the gold.
5142-33396-0040  and these shall follow your thralls in the same way.
5142-33396-0048  By the hammer of Thor, shouted Grimm, there is no stingy coward.
5142-33396-0049  Here, friend, take it and thrust into the farmer's hands.
5142-33396-0050  May you drink heart's ease from it for many years.
5142-33396-0052  Here is a ring for Sif the Friendly, and here is a bracelet, and a sword will not be ashamed to hang at your side.
5142-33396-0055  That time it pointed us into your father's ships.
5142-33396-0061  Your mother, the queen, is standing by.
5142-33396-0062  Now she put her hand on his arm and smiled and said,
5142-33396-0065  Soft heart, he said gently to her. Then to Torquo. Well, let him go, Torquo.
5142-36377-0004  She signed to me with a ghostly solemnity to take the vacant place on the left of her father.
5142-36377-0012  Make acquaintance with Mr. Iago. Sit together.
5142-36377-0014  A pretty girl, and so far as I could judge by appearances, a good girl, too. Describing her generally, I may say that she had a small head, well-carried, and well-set on her shoulders. Bright gray eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked. A trim, slight little figure. Too slight for our English notions of beauty. A strong American accent. And a rare thing. Pleasant and talented. A faint accent of English.
5142-36377-0015  Our first impressions of people are, in 9 cases out of 10, the right impressions.
5142-36586-0003  but this subject will be more properly discussed when we treat the different races of mankind.
5639-40744-0002  Rodolfo and his companions, with their faces muffled in their cloaks, stared rudely and insolently at the mother, the daughter, and the servant-maid.
5639-40744-0014  Among other things on which he cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window.
5639-40744-0015  This person was Rodolfo, who though he had gone to look for his friends had changed his mind in that respect, not thinking it advisable to acquaint them with what had passed between him and...
5639-40744-0018  That would be very well, my child, replied her father, if your plan were not liable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning. But no doubt this image had been already missed by its owner. But it was taken out of the room by the person who had died.
5639-40744-0021  She, meanwhile, passed her life and her parents in the strictest retirement, never letting herself be seen, but shunning every artist that she knew of her future in her face.
5639-40744-0025  The bed she too well remembered was there, and above all the cabinet on which had stood the image she had taken away was still on the same spot.
5639-40744-0040  This was done, but the events were placed at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of the night, without any of the preliminaries which are now so properly required.
5683-32865-0010  I was thinking it's very like the ace of hearts, answered the captain softly, smiling on him.
5683-32865-0011  Whereupon Lake laughed quietly, still looking at the Ace of Hearts with his sly eyes.
5683-32865-0013  Do you know? Blake? Oh, I really can't tell, but he'll soon tire of country life.
5683-32865-0014  He's not a man for country quarters.
5683-32866-0000  Miss Lake declined the carriage tonight.
5683-32866-0002  Don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly?
5683-32866-0005  And he made a little dip of his can towards Brandon Hawk over his shoulder.
5683-32866-0019  the mystery of their origin, their capacity for evolving latent faculties of crime, and the steady vitality with which they survive their curse, and speak their dark-mouth malignities in every newborn generation, have associated them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct from human and the special satanic action.
5683-32866-0020  before more than anything else showed the great age of the room.
5683-32866-0027  The cold white moon was shining with sharp lights and shadows.
5683-32866-0030  a little bit of pasta, a tumble down the chimney. It startled me, it startled me.
5683-32879-0001  Well, she was better. Well, she had had a bad idea.
5683-32879-0012  Thank you, Rachel. My cousin Rachel. My only friend.
5683-32879-0013  "'Chelford had a note from Mr. Wilder this morning. "'Another note, his coming delayed, "'and something of his having to see some person who was abroad,' "'continued Dorcas after a little pause.
5683-32879-0015  Yes, said Rachel.
5683-32879-0016  and the wan orc had spoken. She sat down in the same sort of abstraction again beside Dorcas, and she looked full in her cousin's eyes.
5683-32879-0022  I like you still, Rachel. I'm sure I'll always like you.
5683-32879-0023  You resemble me, Rachel. You are fearless and inflexible and jealous.
5683-32879-0024  Yes, Rachel, I do love you.
61-70968-0000  He began a confused complaint against the wizard, who had vanished behind the curtain on the left.
61-70968-0003  He was like unto my father in a way, and yet was not my father.
61-70968-0006  But then the picture was gone as quickly as it came.
61-70968-0013  Before them fled the stroller and his three sons, Kaplis and Terahai.
61-70968-0021  Surely we can submit with good grace.
61-70968-0028  The head and chief of the riot, the Nottingham apprentice, with a clenched fist, threatened Mon Fichet.
61-70968-0034  I must be sure! I must be sure! E-Roll to the rescue!
61-70968-0040  Right willingly, for between us we have won the battle, answered Robin.
61-70968-0047  Master Monceau, the sheriff of Nottingham, was mightily put about when told of the rioting.
61-70968-0053  He is my Esquire, Excellency, returned Robert with dignity.
61-70968-0056  The wine did certainly bring back the color to the squire's cheeks.
61-70968-0059  It would be no disappointment to me.
61-70970-0000  Young Fitzuth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his congress with the squire.
61-70970-0002  Most of all, Robin thought of his father. What would he counsel?
61-70970-0009  It is late, and I go myself within a short space.
61-70970-0014  Presently, he crossed the floor of his room with decided step.
61-70970-0016  We will go out together to the bower. There is a way down to the court from my window.
61-70970-0024  They moved thereafter cautiously about the hut, groping before and about them to find something to show that he wanted to fulfill his mission.
61-70970-0026  Fatuth's hand rested at last upon the top rung of the ladder, and slowly the truth came to him.
61-70970-0029  From the blackness behind the light they heard a voice, Warrington's.
61-70970-0030  Save the monsters that you started very well.
61-70970-0035  Warrington spoke thus with significance to show Robin that he was not to think Jeffrey's claims to the estate when he passed by.
61-70970-0038  The old servant told him quietly as he prepped after me. His passageway led from the hut in the Pleasance to Sherwood, and that Geoffrey, for the time, was hiding with the outlaws in the forest.
672-122797-0005  Oh, that made him so angry.
672-122797-0007  In autumn, the woodcutters always came and felled some of the largest trees.
672-122797-0010  Rejoice in my breath.
672-122797-0016  Yes, and something better, something still grander will surely follow. Wherefore should they thus ornament me?
672-122797-0017  Something's better, something's still up and you must follow. What?
672-122797-0018  The joys of our Christmas, said the air and the sunlight.
672-122797-0019  Rejoice in thy own fresh youth!
672-122797-0027  The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated it.
672-122797-0032  I'll be young ladies. I can't help it out the fire.
672-122797-0034  A story, cried the children, drawing a little fat man towards the tree.
672-122797-0035  Thank you.
672-122797-0038  thought for a truth. He believed it all, because the man who told the story was so good-looking. Well, well...
672-122797-0047  How kind man is, after all!
672-122797-0050  They snuffed about the fir tree and rustled on the branches.
672-122797-0056  The fir tree, thinking over what he had himself devoted,
672-122797-0062  No, said the tree.
672-122797-0064  At last, the little mice stayed away also, and the tree sighed. After all, it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listened to what I told them.
672-122797-0067  The trunks were moved. The tree was pulled out and thrown. Rather hard, it is true, down on the floor. But a man drew him towards the stairs.
6829-68769-0000  Kenneth and Beth refrained from telling the other girls or Uncle John of Old Will Rogers' visit, but they got Mr. Watson in the library and questioned him closely with the penalty for forging a check.
6829-68769-0001  It was a serious crime indeed, Mr. Watson told them, and Tom Gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in the state's prison as a consequence of his rash act.
6829-68769-0013  May we see Pates at once, asked Kenneth.
6829-68769-0015  Sometimes I'm back there to first smoke, I'm really crazy. I don't know which one is dying one way or the other.
6829-68769-0041  I'm not electioneering just now.
6829-68769-0045  I'll pay all the costs besides.
6829-68769-0046  You're foolish. Why should you do this?
6829-68769-0048  Give me a check for 150, and I'll turn over to you the forge check and quash further proceedings.
6829-68769-0052  He might have had that forged check for the face of it if he'd been sharp.
6829-68769-0053  and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of $150.
6829-68771-0002  the weak-kneed contingency must be strengthened and fortified, and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from the opposition.
6829-68771-0005  The only thing necessary was to fix Seth Reynolds, and this Hopkins arranged personally.
6829-68771-0006  And this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy.
6829-68771-0021  But it can be, protested the girl.
6829-68771-0023  You speak like an educated person, said Beth wonderingly. Where is your home?
6829-68771-0033  She rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath.
6829-68771-0035  Will you leave me alone in my own room or must I go away to escape you?
6829-68771-0036  Eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked in the lock.
6930-75918-0001  The English forwarded to the French baskets of flowers, of which they had made a plentiful provision to greet the arrival of the young princes. The French, in return, invited the English to assemble, which was to be given the next day.
6930-75918-0005  the count had thrown himself back on his seat leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and restless limbs
6930-75918-0014  But, continued Rao, not interrupted by this movement of his friend, heaven be praised, the French, who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet, reckless even, are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to mineral patterns of such a high importance.
6930-75918-0020  Bragalon watched for some time the conduct of the two lovers, listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of Mandator, who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold instead of his violet suit.
6930-76324-0000  Goliath makes another discovery.
6930-76324-0006  Hers happened to be on the same frame to Washington the day they didn't care about it.
6930-76324-0008  I thought we were stuck to get rid of the first solid pressure, but it was been of some use after all.
6930-76324-0017  Oh, let him come along, she urged. I do love to see him about that old house.
6930-76324-0018  he makes it sort of cozier.
6930-76324-0025  They both cried, peering in.
6930-81414-0001  I heard a noise behind. I turned and saw Kaffir, his black eyes shining, while in his hand he held a gleaming knife. He lifted it above his head as if to strike, but I had the strength of ten men, and I hurled him from me.
6930-81414-0014  In the light of the moon, I saw a knife, red with blood, and my hand, too, was also discontent.
6930-81414-0018  I remember saying, have we been together?
7021-79730-0002  by reason and affection.
7021-79740-0009  Oh, wow. Let's go.
7021-79740-0012  said she, pointing to the plate. See?
7021-79740-0014  And this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes.
7021-85628-0000  But Anders cared nothing about that.
7021-85628-0004  Yes, why not, Father?
7021-85628-0008  For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
7021-85628-0011  The princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses, and she let Anders sit in a golden chair by her side.
7021-85628-0020  We've got lightning through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
7127-75946-0001  Ah, very well.
7127-75946-0014  The queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dais or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction.
7127-75946-0020  Far from it, Simon. Your Majesty haven't given no directions about it, and musicians have singed it.
7127-75947-0001  Upon this, Madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the Comte, observing,
7127-75947-0005  I allude to the garbage.
7127-75947-0007  She then rose, humming the air to which she was presently going to dance.
7127-75947-0008  The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.
7127-75947-0013  I remember now, and I congratulate myself. Do you love anyone?
7127-75947-0014  Forgive me, I hardly know what I am saying. A thousand times forgive me. The dam was right, quite right, and the big size completely changed my brain.
7127-75947-0031  Keep it positive.
7127-75947-0037  Oh, I am speaking seriously, replied Montalé, and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the king's, I suppose. Is it not, Louise?
7176-88083-0007  but such was his keenness that even though the wide fleets of his ignored victim were still sticking out at the corners of his beak, his fierce red eyes were once more peering downward into the torrent in search of fresh prey.
7176-88083-0008  In despair, he hurled himself out and came to sleep.
7176-88083-0012  upon a little bit of a branch inside upright, motionless as of surprise.
7176-88083-0018  where he squirted towards the heights of air, took all his savage vows, was troubled at the leaping waves and tossed their fingers in their lapids. He did not understand them.
7176-88083-0020  where the waves one instant sank, they turned open, but not quite as fast as it was.
7176-88083-0021  But as before, the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer, and he was able to flap his way over without a phone, while dude hung low above his head and hesitated to strike.
7176-88083-0026  The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inextricable to him and appalling.
7176-92135-0001  In short, he becomes a prominent figure in London society, and if he is not careful, somebody will say so.
7176-92135-0002  But even the ends of such a dramatist has his moments.
7176-92135-0008  Lend me your ear for 10 minutes and you shall learn just what stagecraft is.
7176-92135-0016  This would be an easy way of doing it, but it would not be the best way, for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself.
7176-92135-0024  To be or not to be. That is the question. Whether team knows where to be.
7176-92135-0029  I want to get away from it all! Sweet!
7176-92135-0031  And there you are. We will look first to ensure that the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the same as the ovens are the
7176-92135-0033  Why not? This is the sun.
7176-92135-0038  The stage meal is popular because it proves to the audience that the actors, even when called Charles Haltrey or Owen Nears, are real people just like you and me.
7176-92135-0039  T, please, Matthews. Butler, impassable.
7729-102255-0000  The bogus legislature numbered 36 members.
7729-102255-0005  This was a formable array of advantages. Slavery was playing loaded dice.
7729-102255-0006  Coming by way of the Missouri River towns, he fell first among border ruffian companionship and influences, and perhaps having his inclinations already molded by his Washington instructions, his early impressions were decided to reverse to the Free State Prize.
7729-102255-0008  All the territorial dignitaries were present. Governor Shannon and John Calhoun, the Surveyor General, made the principal speech a denunciation of the abolitionists supporting the speech movement. Chief Justice McComps dignified the occasion with approving remarks.
7729-102255-0021  that the affair was magnified as a crowning truth that the Free State men were insurrectionists in their dominance.
7729-102255-0038  Atchison, who had been haranguing the mob, planted his two guns before the building and trained them...
8224-274381-0008  With these and some reinforcements of the Athol men and MacDonalds whom we have recalled, Montreux fell suddenly upon Argyle's country, and let loose upon it all the rage of war, carrying off the cattle, burning their houses, and putting the inhabitants to the shore.
8224-274381-0010  By a quick and unexpected march, Montrose hastened to Inner Lockie and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not afraid
8224-274381-0012  Montrose, weakly heavily, nearly one of his troops of force, and after putting the enemy's horse to ground, fell with united force upon their foot, who were entirely cut in pieces, though with the loss of the gallant Lord Gordon on the part of the Royalists,
8224-274381-0014  Besides members of the army who were excluded, many officers who were willing to serve under the new generals threw up their mission and unwarily facilitated the project of putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction.
8224-274381-0015  Though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible, a more exact plan was introduced, and rigorously executed by these new commandments.
8224-274384-0000  He passed through Henley, St Albans, and came so near to London as Harrow on the Hill.
8224-274384-0006  The king stood up and called for that psalm which begins with these words.
8230-279154-0000  The analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the 13th century, under the most difficult part of our whole entire planet.
8230-279154-0005  All that I'm doing is to use its lifeblocks new data as a help in the analysis for effort when moving back.
8230-279154-0007  Habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times. If the behaviorist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit, that can only be because he trusts his anger when it assures him that there have been other times.
8230-279154-0011  Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar while others feel strange.
8230-279154-0018  There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporary relation of a remembered event with the present and knowing the time limit of two remembered events.
8230-279154-0019  It would seem that only rather recent dates can be placed at all accurately by means of fillings given their particular relation to the present. But it is clear that such fillings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events.
8230-279154-0027  A gramophone, by the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidence of its path, and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe.
8230-279154-0031  They give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds, but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences, which is what constitutes knowledge.
8230-279154-0036  A further stage is recognition.
8230-279154-0042  Thus, if I recognize a thing, the occasion of its previous existence, in virtue of which I recognize it, forms part of my experience by definition. Recognition will be one of the parts by which my experience is singled out in the rest of the world.
8455-210777-0000  I remained there alone for many hours, but I must acknowledge that before I left the chambers, I had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light.
8455-210777-0014  Sir Kennington Oval is a very fine player, said my wife.
8455-210777-0018  This, she said, was true hospitality. And I'm not sure that I did not agree with that.
8455-210777-0019  Then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives, who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies.
8455-210777-0031  You have received thanks for all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in your life stands so high.
8455-210777-0032  He doesn't do it.
8455-210777-0033  But your power is so secure as you're going to go out of your hand. It can make us fear, fear, and fear. No disgrace, no weakness.
8455-210777-0036  I can afford to smile because I am absolutely powerless before you, but I do not to less feel that in the manner of which the progress of the world is concerned, I, or rather we, have been put down by brute force.
8455-210777-0043  But what does the delicate mission have?
8455-210777-0046  You may be quite sure it's there, said Captain Manilax, and that I can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board.
8455-210777-0050  One of us always remains on board while the aliens are here.
8455-210777-0052  You will allow me to suggest, said he, that that is a matter of opinion.
8455-210777-0058  It is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work.
8455-210777-0064  And I have no one ready to whom I can give up the archives of the government.
8463-287645-0006  The doctor who attended the injured creature in this case was simply told that she slipped and fell down the stairs as she was coming down.
8463-287645-0007  Another case, said John Westwood, was a little girl, half-grown, who was washing windows upstairs one day, and unluckily fell asleep from the window, and in this position was found by her mistress. In a rage, the mistress hit her a heavy slap, knocked her out of the window, and she fell to the pavement, and died in a few hours from the affair.
8463-287645-0011  She was a large, homely woman. They were common white people with no reputation in unity.
8463-294825-0000  It's almost beyond projection.
8463-294825-0002  First as a Paris stockbroker, later as a celebrated author and yachtsman, he went on frequent voyages to Britain, America, the Mediterranean.
8463-294828-0011  He went here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment.
8463-294828-0012  Please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting that I had turned forty.
8463-294828-0015  What's that? That's all the birds. Okay, come here.
8463-294828-0025  But we're going just the same.
8463-294828-0028  I opened a line of credits sufficient to cover the Barbarossa, and, conseil at my heels, I jumped into a carriage.
8463-294828-0030  I asked for Commander Farragut.
8463-294828-0033  I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's house.
8463-294828-0035  and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism
8555-284447-0000  Then he rushed downstairs into the courtyard, shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch everybody in his dominions if the ceremony was not recaptured.
8555-284447-0005  The rim of the great knife was high and big, and around it men worried the pages for the spectators to sit down.
8555-284447-0012  The captain shook his head.
8555-284447-0014  The idea of what you tell him where to go because it makes me easier to go. And the more he thought of it, the more he would, the more he would.
8555-284447-0023  I couldn't shiver much being bound so tight. When you lose, I'll need to have just one good shiver to relieve my feelings.
8555-284449-0001  Then they all marched out a little way into the fields, and found that the army of Pinkies had already formed, and was advancing steadily toward them.
8555-284449-0002  At the head of the Pinkies were Gip Gisinski and Button Bright, who had the parrot on his shoulder, and they were supported by Captain Coralie, and Captain Tintant, and Rosalie.
8555-284449-0006  Don't worry, Sizzledear. It'll all come right pretty soon.
8555-284449-0012  And I'll give the honour with all the shavings and lettering to the hands of me, besides the grass.
8555-284449-0015  I'll not be wicked anymore sighed the old guru I'll reform
8555-284449-0017  When first they entered the throne room, they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever. But the blues who were a single pair, they loved the country. For those in a single person, all the blue country who loved the princesses, the least little bit.
8555-292519-0001  Guided by you. How we might stroll towards death. Our only music, one another's breath. Through gardens intimate with high hearts. Where silent poppies burn between the rocks. By pools where birches dance. Scummed with lily plants.
908-157963-0008  thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shalt be clothed in light and fed with morning manna till summer's heat melts in the summer mountains in the spring to flourish in eternal vales they why should fell complain
908-157963-0010  She ceased and smiled at him, then sat down with her silver shawl.
908-157963-0012  But that is why I came from the kingdom of the rising sun. I banish from my holy ground, and who shall find my peace?
908-157963-0014  to send a little sound and have it before these kinds of stuff.
908-157963-0016  I pass away, yet I complain, and no one hears my voice.
908-157963-0030  Why an ear, a whirlpool, fierce to draw creations in?
908-31957-0000  Always said without a word.
908-31957-0007  Could it mean, to last, a love set, pendulous between sorrow and sorrow?
908-31957-0012  If he, to keep one oath, must lose one joy, like his life's star foretold.
908-31957-0014  A ring of amethyst I could not wear here, plainer to my side than that first kiss.
908-31957-0015  That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown, but sanctifying sweetness, did perceive that the third upon my lips was folded down in purple, purple skin. Since when, indeed, I have been proud and said, My life, my glory.
908-31957-0020  I thank all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine.
