1089-134686-0007  A cold, lucid indifference reigned in his soul.
1089-134686-0012  Her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity. Her holiness, a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who approached her.
1089-134686-0024  If the wine change into vinegar, and the host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated, is Jesus Christ still present under their species as God and as man?
1089-134686-0031  Stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.
1089-134686-0037  In the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny glow.
1089-134691-0001  For a full hour he had paced up and down, waiting, but he could wait no longer.
1089-134691-0012  It was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and in beggars' weeds, that they would be generous towards him, loving him as themselves.
1188-133604-0001  They unite every quality, and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists, sometimes as chiaroscurists.
1188-133604-0003  My first and principal reason was that they enforced, beyond all resistance, on any student who might attempt to copy them, this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side.
1188-133604-0004  Some of the touches indeed, when the tint has been mixed with much water, have been laid in little drops or ponds, so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge.
1188-133604-0009  Now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues, it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper. And that I am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it, being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly.
1188-133604-0014  Do not, therefore, think that the Gothic school is an easy one.
1188-133604-0016  This at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative, that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way, but not under existing conditions, and that, in fact, you are producing jeweler's work rather than pictures.
1188-133604-0024  Nothing will be more precious to you, I think, in the practical study of art than the conviction, which will force itself on you more and more every hour, of the way all things are bound together, little and great, in spirit and in matter.
1188-133604-0027  Now here is Raphael. Exactly between the two, trees still drawn leaf by leaf, wholly formal, but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance.
1188-133604-0031  There's one and there's another, the Dudley and the Flint.
1188-133604-0040  The crampness and the poverty are all intended.
1188-133604-0041  It is a gleener bringing down her one sheaf of corn to an old water mill, itself mossy and rent, scarcely able to get its stones to turn.
1188-133604-0042  The scene is absolutely Arcadian.
121-121726-0003  Hey, fever! A heart trouble caused by falling in love with a grass widow.
121-121726-0005  hedge a fence
121-121726-0011  Husband. The next thing to a wife.
121-123859-0000  You are my all the world, and I must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue. None else to me, nor I to none alive, that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.
121-127105-0001  Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following.
121-127105-0002  cried one of the women. He took no notice of her. He looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of.
121-127105-0004  The story's written.
121-127105-0007  To this, his answer was prompt. Oh, thank God, no. And is the record yours?
121-127105-0008  He hung fire again. A woman's.
121-127105-0014  You are acute.
121-127105-0019  Mrs Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more light.
121-127105-0024  Poor Douglas, before his death, when it was in sight, committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth.
121-127105-0028  The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations, and that his own affairs took up all his time.
121-127105-0029  There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority.
121-127105-0034  It sounded dull, but sounded strange, and all the more so because of his main condition, which was—
121-127105-0036  But was that all her reward? One of the ladies asked.
1221-135766-0000  How strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant, and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child.
1221-135766-0001  God, as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished, had given her a lovely child, whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connect her parent forever with the race and descent of mortals, and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven.
1221-135766-0005  Hester could only account for the child's character, and even then most vaguely and imperfectly, by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while Pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth.
1221-135767-0004  We have spoken of Pearl's rich and luxuriant beauty, a beauty that's shown with deep and vivid tints, a bright complexion, eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow, and hair already of a deep glossy brown, and which, in after years, would be nearly akin to black.
1221-135767-0013  Lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal, Hester Prynne gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor's bond-servants, a free-born Englishman, but now a seven-year slave.
1221-135767-0022  But the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate, on this side of the Atlantic, in a hard soil, and amid the close struggle for subsistence, the native English taste for ornamental gardening.
1284-1180-0000  He wore blue silk stockings, blue knee pants with gold buckles, a blue ruffled waist, and a jacket of bright blue braided with gold.
1284-1180-0003  For a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of ours in which they lived.
1284-1180-0009  Then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of Dr. Pippt.
1284-1180-0014  Ojo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life.
1284-1180-0018  It takes me several years to make this magic powder, but at this moment I am pleased to say it is nearly done. You see, I am making it for my good wife, Margolot, who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own.
1284-1180-0021  I think the next glass cap the magician makes will have neither brains nor heart, for then it will not object to catching mice, and may prove of some use to us.
1284-1180-0023  You see, I've lived all my life with Uncle Nunky, the silent one, and there was no one to tell me anything.
1284-1180-0026  But first I will tell you that for many years I have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cook the meals and wash the dishes.
1284-1180-0030  When I found it, I said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl, for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty, as the glass cat is, for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are.
1284-1181-0005  No, I forgot all about the brains," exclaimed the woman.
1284-1181-0006  Well, that may be true," agreed Margolot. But on the contrary, a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work.
1284-1181-0007  She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.
1284-1181-0008  I think that will do, she continued, for the other qualities are not needed in a servant.
1284-1181-0010  Their contents had all boiled away, leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder.
1284-1181-0011  Very carefully, the magician removed this powder, placing it all together in a golden dish, where he mixed it with a golden spoon.
1284-1181-0017  The Wizard of Oz, who used to be a humbug and knew no magic at all, has been taking lessons of Glenda, and I'm told he is getting to be a pretty good wizard, but he is merely the assistant of the great sorcerers.
1284-134647-0001  The Edict of Milan, the great charter of toleration, had confirmed to each individual of the Roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion.
1284-134647-0003  Constantine easily believed that the heretics, who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands, were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy, and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation.
1284-134647-0004  Some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of Diocletian, and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity.
1320-122612-0003  He often stopped to examine the trees, nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity, the velocity, and the color of its waters.
1320-122612-0004  distrusting his own judgment, his appeals to the opinion of Chingacuk were frequent and earnest.
1320-122612-0012  Extinguished brands were lying around a spring. The offals of a deer were scattered about the place, and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses.
1320-122617-0001  In his return to the camp, his acute and practiced intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own.
1320-122617-0004  The ingenious Hawkeye, who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman, was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation.
1320-122617-0009  I greatly mourn that one so well-disposed should die in his ignorance, and I have sought her goodly him. Can you lead me to him?"
1320-122617-0018  It was silent and gloomy, being tenanted solely by the captive, and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery.
1320-122617-0019  Unkas occupy a distant corner in a reclining attitude, being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful widths.
1320-122617-0020  The scout, who had left David at the door to ascertain they were not observed, thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy.
1320-122617-0028  My pursuits are peaceful, and my temper, I humbly trust, is greatly given to mercy and love, return David a little net-hold at so direct an attack on his manhood. But there are none who can say that I have ever forgotten my faith in the Lord, even in the greatest straits.
1320-122617-0032  Keep silent as long as may be, and it would be wise when you do speak, to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings, which will serve to remind the Indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be.
1580-141083-0003  Without his scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man.
1580-141083-0006  The only duplicate which existed so far as I knew was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister, a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion.
1580-141083-0009  The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers.
1580-141083-0013  Above all things, I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly.
1580-141083-0017  So it seems to me...
1580-141083-0042  My scholar has been left very poor, but he is hardworking and industrious. He will do well.
1580-141083-0044  I dare not go so far as that, but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely."
1580-141083-0046  But I have occasionally done the same thing at other times.
1580-141084-0003  No names, please, said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchristor.
1580-141084-0010  I will take the black clay with me, also the pencil cuttings. Goodbye.
1580-141084-0017  No good, my dear Watson.
1580-141084-0034  Well, well, don't trouble to answer. Listen and see that I do you know injustice.
1580-141084-0035  he could examine the papers in his own office.
1580-141084-0042  A sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs.
1580-141084-0044  Gloves, said the young man.
1580-141084-0048  It will be clear to you, from what I have said, that only you could have let this young man out, since you were left in the room, and must have locked the door when you went out.
1580-141084-0050  If Mr. Soames saw them, the game was up.
1995-1826-0000  In the debate between the senior societies, her defense of the 15th Amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning, but delivered with real enthusiasm.
1995-1826-0004  might learn something useful down there.
1995-1826-0005  But John, there's no society, just elementary work.
1995-1826-0009  You ought to know, John. If I teach Negroes, I'll scarcely see much of people in my own class.
1995-1826-0012  She wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms.
1995-1826-0015  She had almost forgotten that it was here within touch and sight.
1995-1826-0022  I suppose, though, it's too early for them. Then came the explosion.
1995-1826-0024  The golden fleece. It's the silver fleece. He harkened.
1995-1836-0007  Do you believe in some education? Ask Mary Taylor.
1995-1836-0008  I believe in the training of people to their highest capacity. The Englishman here heartily seconded him.
1995-1837-0003  The revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder.
1995-1837-0010  Perhaps she too might be there, waiting, weeping.
1995-1837-0016  For one long moment he passed, stupid, agape, with utter amazement, then leaned dizzily against the tree.
1995-1837-0023  The net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her. She had struggled in dumb, speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life, with gnarled and creeping fingers. But now at last, weekly, she opened her eyes and questioned.
2094-142345-0000  It is a very fine old place of red brick, softened by a pale, powdery lichen, which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity, so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables, the windows, and the door place.
2094-142345-0005  several clothes horses, a pillion, a spinning wheel, and an old box wide open and stuffed full of colored rags.
2094-142345-0007  The history of the house is plain now.
2094-142345-0011  Do not suppose, however, that Mrs. Poiser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance. She was a good-looking woman, not more than eight and thirty, a fair complexion and sandy hair, well-shapen, light-footed.
2094-142345-0023  You are a rarer and for sitting down to your work a little while after it's time to put by.
2094-142345-0035  But not more than what's in the Bible and, said Dinah.
2094-142345-0036  Nay, dear aunt, you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work and their families.
2094-142345-0039  I have strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children from anything I have done.
2094-142345-0043  By this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down from their horses. It was plain they meant to come in.
2094-142345-0045  Oh, sir, don't mention it," said Mrs. Poiser.
2094-142345-0057  I know his farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us. And as for the kitchen, he added, smiling. I don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it.
2300-131720-0005  Why, if we erect a station at the falls, it is a great economy to get it up to the city.
2300-131720-0008  Everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy, the contraction of space, the intensification of culture.
237-126133-0004  if she could only see Franzi for just one moment.
237-126133-0005  Oh, she's always at the piano, said Van. She must be there now, somewhere. And then somebody laughed.
237-126133-0023  He cried and hid dudgeon, just as if he owned the whole of the peppers, and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy.
237-126133-0024  And the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short, happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time.
237-134493-0000  It is sixteen years since John Berkson died.
237-134493-0002  From the Norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checkerboard, marked off in squares of wheat and corn, light and dark, dark and light.
237-134493-0006  That's not much of a job for an athlete. Here I've been to town and back.
237-134493-0012  I get wet to my knees when I go down to pick cherries.
237-134493-0018  There is even a white row of beehives in the orchard under the walnut trees.
237-134500-0002  A brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky.
237-134500-0006  Just smell the wild roses. They are always so spicy after a rain.
237-134500-0018  He reached up among the branches, and began to pick the sweet, insipid fruit. Long ivory-coloured berries tipped with faint pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheated all summer through.
237-134500-0029  I don't want to stand around and look on.
237-134500-0038  And anyhow, there's nothing to understand.
237-134500-0040  I pray for you, but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself.
260-123286-0000  Saturday, August 15th. The sea unbroken all round. No land in sight.
260-123286-0009  I take this as my answer and I leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience.
260-123286-0016  These thoughts agitated me all day, and my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours' sleep.
260-123286-0025  Flight was out of the question now. The reptiles rose. They wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains.
260-123288-0000  The Roarings become lost in the distance.
260-123288-0014  Honster is not.
260-123288-0021  The waves rise above our heads.
260-123288-0022  They seem to be we are lost, but I am not sure.
260-123288-0024  The fireball, half of it white, half azure blue, and the size of a 10 inch shell moves slowly about the raft, but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity, as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind.
260-123288-0026  We shall be blown up, but no. The dazzling disc of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside. It approaches Hans, who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily. It threatens the head of my uncle, who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it.
260-123440-0005  And yesterday, things went on just as usual.
260-123440-0007  I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
260-123440-0009  I shall never get to 20 at that rate.
260-123440-0011  No, I've made up my mind about it. If I'm able, I'll stay down here.
260-123440-0014  And I declare it's too bad that it is.
260-123440-0019  cried Alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended.
2830-3979-0000  We want you to help us publish some leading work of Luther's for the general American market. Will you do it?
2830-3980-0000  In every way, they sought to undermine the authority of St. Paul.
2830-3980-0001  They said to the Galatians, you have no right to think highly of Paul.
2830-3980-0016  It spoils one's best work.
2830-3980-0017  When I was a young man, I thought Paul was making too much of his call.
2830-3980-0021  and God the Father who raised him from the dead.
2830-3980-0023  These perverters of the righteousness of Christ resist the Father and the Son and the works of them both.
2830-3980-0027  and all the brethren which are with me.
2830-3980-0032  We look for that reward which I hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man.
2830-3980-0049  Embrace him and forget about the nature of God.
2830-3980-0054  that Christ is very God, is apparent in that Paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the Father, as for instance the power to dispense grace and peace.
2830-3980-0056  Otherwise, Paul should have written Grace from God the Father and Peace from our Lord Jesus Christ.
2830-3980-0061  Not gold, or silver, or partial lambs, or an angel, but himself. What for?
2961-960-0002  In the supposed depths of this dialogue, the Neoplatanists found hidden meanings in connections with the Jewish and Christian scriptures, and out of them, they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of Plato.
2961-960-0004  There is no danger of the modern commentators on the Timaeus falling into the absurdities of the Neoplatonists.
2961-960-0005  In the present day, we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought.
2961-960-0015  The style and plan of the Timeas differ greatly from that of any other of the Platonic Dialogues.
2961-960-0018  But in the rest of the work, the power of language seems to fail him, and the dramatic form is wholly given up.
2961-960-0019  He could write in one style, but not in another, and the Greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena.
2961-961-0003  I will, if Timmy as approves. I approve.
2961-961-0010  But in Egypt, the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered forever in our temples.
2961-961-0014  9000 years have elapsed since she founded yours, and 8000 since she founded ours, as our annals record.
2961-961-0015  Many laws exist among us, which are the counterpart of yours, as they were in the olden time.
2961-961-0017  Observe again what care the law took in the pursuit of wisdom, searching out the deep things of the world, and applying them to the use of men.
2961-961-0022  Then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment. First, Timeyes, who is a natural philosopher, will speak of the origin of the world, going down to the creation of men. And then, I shall receive the men whom he has created, and some of whom will have been educated by you, and introduce them to you as the lost Athenian citizens of whom the Egyptian records spoke.
3570-5694-0001  The utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth.
3570-5694-0005  Under the taboo, certain victuals and more particularly, certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class.
3570-5694-0006  Drunkiness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the secondary move of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence.
3570-5694-0007  It has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle.
3570-5694-0018  The wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes, the free and the servile, or the noble and the ignoble.
3570-5694-0019  But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.
3570-5695-0000  In a general way, though not wholly nor consistently, these two groups coincide.
3570-5695-0003  In the communities of the Western culture, this point is at present found among the lower middle class.
3570-5695-0014  Among the country population, its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute.
3570-5696-0001  But the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme. Leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods, both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi-peaceful culture.
3570-5696-0008  But it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterised as wasteful.
3575-170457-0001  Why are we to be denied each other's society?
3575-170457-0011  But it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you consult your own happiness.
3575-170457-0012  You will say that a woman has no need of such a caution. There can be no peril in it for her.
3575-170457-0018  Sir, March 16th.
3575-170457-0022  In the evenings I confess, I do think, but I never trouble anyone else with my thoughts.
3575-170457-0025  Again, I thank you. This incident, I suppose, will be renewed no more. If I live to be an old woman, I shall remember it 30 years hence as a bright dream.
3575-170457-0026  P.S. Preiser, excuse me for writing to you a second time. I could not help writing, partly to tell you how thankful I am for your kindness, and partly to let you know that your advice shall not be wasted. However, sorrowfully and reluctantly, it may be at first followed. C.B.
3575-170457-0029  Your letter has given me great pleasure, and I should not forgive myself if I did not tell you so.
3575-170457-0032  Come, come, I'm getting really tired of your absence.
3575-170457-0044  After this disappointment, I never dare reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of a pleasure again. It seems as if some fatality stood between you and me.
3729-6852-0002  In order to please her, I spoke to her of the Abbey Conti, and I had occasion to quote two lines of that profound writer.
3729-6852-0013  You do me a great honour.
3729-6852-0016  Madame Quincen, besides, can answer your inquiries.
3729-6852-0019  I tell him to give me some coffee if it is good.
3729-6852-0022  I address him in Italian, and he answers very wittily, but his way of speaking makes me smile, and I tell him why.
3729-6852-0026  Yes, but the meridian of the Palais Royale is the most exact.
3729-6852-0029  It is sold everywhere, but for the last three weeks, nobody will use any snuff, but that's sold at the Savette Cat.
3729-6852-0031  But how did she manage to render it so fashionable?
3729-6852-0037  She introduced me to all her guests and gave me some particulars respecting every one of them.
3729-6852-0043  I reside in the Marais Grude du Porte.
3729-6852-0045  He had a good appetite, could tell a good story without laughing, was celebrated for his witty repartets and his sociable manners, but he spent his life at home, seldom going out and seeing hardly anyone, because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least twenty cats with which he would amuse himself all day.
4077-13751-0000  On the 6th of April, 1830, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was formerly organized and thus took on a legal existence.
4077-13751-0001  its origin was small, a germ, an insignificant seed, hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition.
4077-13754-0016  And so the story of Mormonism runs on. Its finale has not yet been written. The current press presents continuously new stages of its progress, new developments of its plan.
4446-2271-0018  She considered for a moment and then said, No, I think not. The way I'm glad you asked me.
4446-2271-0019  After that it was easy to forget, actually to forget.
4446-2271-0022  I'm glad she's held her own since.
4446-2271-0023  After all, we were awfully young.
4446-2271-0024  I shouldn't wonder if she could laugh about it with me now.
4446-2273-0001  They asked him to come to see them in Chelsea, and they spoke very tenderly of Hilda.
4446-2273-0012  Thank you, but I don't like it so well as this.
4446-2273-0013  Have you been in Paris much these late years?
4446-2273-0019  Come, we'll have our coffee in the other room, and you can smoke.
4446-2273-0023  The strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both.
4446-2275-0009  I got in about ten minutes ago.
4446-2275-0014  I can't stand seeing you miserable.
4446-2275-0017  But it's worse now. It's unbearable.
4446-2275-0019  The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can't get at it anymore.
4446-2275-0020  It was myself I was defying Hilda.
4446-2275-0028  Yes, yes, she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him.
4446-2275-0039  I must know about you.
4507-16021-0003  She has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.
4507-16021-0010  We have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act, and, at least, a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted in fulfilled merits.
4507-16021-0012  Why should one halt on the way?
4507-16021-0015  Since when has Malady banished medicine?
4507-16021-0030  Assuredly, if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest, the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study.
4507-16021-0031  And then we insist upon it, the study of social deformities and infirmities, and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy, is not a business in which choice is permitted.
4507-16021-0036  facts form one of these and ideas the other.
4507-16021-0037  There, it clothes itself in word masks, in metaphor rags,
4507-16021-0051  In this world, evidently, the vestibule of another, there are no fortunate.
4507-16021-0053  to diminish the number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous, that is the object.
4507-16021-0058  The flame is the enemy of the wing.
4970-29093-0000  You'll never dig it out of the Astor Library.
4970-29093-0006  Law seemed to him well enough as a science, but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worthwhile to go to law. And all the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the anti-room of the law office where he was writing, Philip invariably advised to settle. No matter how, but settle. Greatly to the disgust of his employer, who knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes with the attendant fees.
4970-29095-0004  I heard father tell cousin Abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy, that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now.
4970-29095-0006  Is thy father willing these should go away to a school of the world's people?
4970-29095-0011  Does D think D could stand it six months?
4970-29095-0015  If I can get patience?
4970-29095-0016  Ruth sat quite still for a time, with face intent and flushed. It was out now.
4970-29095-0023  I have nothing to wear," replied that demure person.
4970-29095-0031  He doesn't say exactly what it is, said Ruth a little dubiously, but it's something about land and railroads and the nose-father that fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how in a new country.
4970-29095-0032  That Philip is honest and he has talent enough if he will stop scribbling to make his way.
4970-29095-0033  Let a box woman are put into, measured for it, and put in young. If we go anywhere, it's in a box, bailed and pinioned and shut in by disabilities.
4970-29095-0034  Why should I rust and be stupid and sit in an action because I am a girl?
4992-23283-0000  But the more forgetfulness had then prevailed, the more powerful was the force of remembrance when she awoke.
4992-23283-0001  Miss Milner's health is not good.
4992-23283-0004  And yet you must own her behavior has warranted them. Has it not been in this particular incoherent and unaccountable?
4992-23283-0008  He seemed to wait for her reply, but as she made none he proceeded.
4992-23283-0009  Oh, my lord cried Miss Woodley with a most forcible accent. You are the last person on earth she would pardon me for entrusting."
4992-23283-0012  Independent of her fortune she has beauty to captivate the heart of any man and with all her follies she has a frankness in her manner, an unaffected wisdom in her thoughts, a vivacity in her conversation and, with all, a softness in her demeanor that might alone engage the affections of a man of the nicest sentiments and the strongest understanding.
4992-41797-0010  Always irritable, cold, indifferent. He had grown rapidly more so as years went on.
4992-41797-0014  When she could not make a rabbit or a bird look real on paper, she searched in her father's books for pictures of its bones.
4992-41797-0017  He wouldn't search, so don't worry," replied Cyril quietly, and the two looked at each other and knew that it was so.
4992-41797-0020  Nancy's curly chestnut crop, shown in the sun, and Olive's thick black plates looked blacker by contrast.
4992-41797-0021  She is wonderful, more wonderful than anybody we've ever seen anywhere, and she draws better than the teacher in Charlestown.
4992-41806-0001  Tonight there was no need of extra heat, and there were great ceremonies to be observed in lighting the fires on the hearth stones.
4992-41806-0007  Olive had painted the motto on a long, narrow panel of canvas and, giving it to Mr. Popham, stood by the fireside while he deftly fitted it into the place prepared for it.
4992-41806-0008  Olive has another lovely gift for the Yellow House, said Mother Kerry Rising, and to carry out the next part of the program we shall have to go in procession upstairs to my bedroom.
4992-41806-0011  Mother Carrie poured coffee, Nancy chocolate, and the others helped serve the sandwiches and cake, donuts and tarts.
4992-41806-0013  Approaching the dining table, he carefully placed the article in the center and removed the cloth.
5105-28233-0003  We don't spin tops, is a favorite saying amongst artillery officers, indicating that they do not shirk their duty by frivolous pursuits. But it must be confessed that Servidak, being naturally idle, was very much given to spinning tops.
5105-28233-0008  When a private in the Eighth Cavalry he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty-eight years of age, but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to Captain Servidak.
5105-28240-0011  I left you on a continent, and here I have the honor of finding you on an island.
5105-28240-0013  Nothing more than you know yourself.
5105-28240-0015  For some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied, and then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions.
5105-28240-0022  It was on the last day of January that the repairs of the schooner were completed.
5105-28241-0006  The log and the compass, therefore, were able to be called upon to do the work of the sextant, which had become utterly useless.
5105-28241-0009  And what demonstration do you offer?" asked Servidak eagerly, that it will not happen.
5105-28241-0011  All the images of his past life floated upon his memory. His thoughts sped away to his native France, only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the Algerian metropolis.
5105-28241-0012  Is it not impossible, he murmured aloud, that any city should disappear so completely?
5105-28241-0015  To the surprise of all, and especially of Lieutenant Procope, the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from four to five fathoms. And although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area, the differences of level were insignificant, not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the sight of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheater.
5142-33396-0008  I painted the eyes red for anger.
5142-33396-0014  Thirty men, one after another, raised their horns and said,
5142-33396-0017  We ate at many men's tables uninvited.
5142-33396-0018  My dragon's belly is never full, and on board went the gold.
5142-33396-0040  and these shall follow your thralls in the same way.
5142-33396-0048  By the hammer of Thor, shouted Grimm, there is no stingy coward.
5142-33396-0049  Here, friend, take it, and he thrust it into the farmer's hand.
5142-33396-0050  May you drink heartsees from it for many years.
5142-33396-0052  Here is a ring for Sifta Friendly, and here is a bracelet, and a sword would not be a shame to hang at your side.
5142-33396-0055  That time it pointed us into your father's ships.
5142-33396-0061  Your mother, the queen, was standing by.
5142-33396-0062  Now she put her hand on his arm and smiled and said,
5142-33396-0065  Soft heart, he said gently to her. Then to Torkle. Well, let him go, Torkle.
5142-36377-0004  She signed to me with a ghostly solemnity to take the vacant place on the left of her father.
5142-36377-0012  Make acquaintance with Ms. Giago. Sit together.
5142-36377-0014  A pretty girl, and so far as I could judge by appearances, a good girl too. Describing her generally, I may say that she had a small head, well carried, and well set on her shoulders. Bright grey eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked. A trim, slight little figure. Too slight for our English notions of beauty. A strong American accent. And, a rare thing in America, a pleasantly tone voice, which made the accent agreeable to English ears.
5142-36377-0015  Our first impressions of people are, in 9 cases out of 10, the right impressions.
5142-36586-0003  But this subject will be more properly discussed when we treat of the different races of mankind.
5639-40744-0002  Rudolfo and his companions, with their faces muffled in their cloaks, stared rudely and insolently at the mother the daughter and the servant made.
5639-40744-0014  Among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window.
5639-40744-0015  This person was Redolfo, who though he had gone to look for his friends had changed his mind in that respect, not thinking it advisable to acquaint them with what had passed between him and the girl.
5639-40744-0018  That would be very well, my child, replied her father, if your plan were not liable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning. But no doubt this image had been already missed by its owner, and he will have set it down for certain that it was taken out of the room by the person he locked up there.
5639-40744-0021  She, meanwhile, passed her life with her parents in the strictest retirement, never letting herself be seen, but shunning every eye, lest it should read her misfortune in her face.
5639-40744-0025  The bed she too well remembered was there, and above all the cabinet, on which had stood the image she had taken away, was still on the same spot.
5639-40744-0040  This was done, for the event took place at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of a marriage. Without any of the preliminary formalities, which are now so properly required.
5683-32865-0010  I was thinking it's very like the Ace of Hearts." Answered the captain softly, smiling on.
5683-32865-0011  Whereupon Lake laughed quietly, still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes.
5683-32865-0013  Do you know? Lake? Oh, I really can't tell, but he'll soon tire of country life.
5683-32865-0014  He's not a man for country quarters.
5683-32866-0000  Miss Lake declined the carriage tonight.
5683-32866-0002  But don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly.
5683-32866-0005  And he made a little dip of his cane towards Brandon Hall over his shoulder.
5683-32866-0019  The mystery of their origin, their capacity for evolving latent faculties of crime, and the steady vitality with which they survive the hearse and speak their deep-mouthed malignities in every newborn generation have associated them somehow in my mind with the spell of life exceeding and distinct from human and the special satanic action.
5683-32866-0020  The floor, more than anything else, showed the great age of the room.
5683-32866-0027  A cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows.
5683-32866-0030  A little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly.
5683-32879-0001  Well, she was better, though she had had a bad night.
5683-32879-0012  Thank you, Rachel. My cousin, Rachel. My only friend.
5683-32879-0013  Chelford had a note from Mr. Wilder this morning, another note, his coming delayed, and something of his having to see some person who was abroad continued dorkess after a little pause.
5683-32879-0015  Yes, said Rachel.
5683-32879-0016  And the wan oracle, having spoken, she sat down in the same sort of abstraction again beside Dorcas, and she looked full in her cousin's eyes.
5683-32879-0022  I like you still, Rachel. I'm sure I'll always like you.
5683-32879-0023  You resemble me, Rachel. You are fearless and inflexible and generous.
5683-32879-0024  Yes Rachel, I do love you.
61-70968-0000  He began a confused complaint against the wizard, who had vanished behind the curtain on the left.
61-70968-0003  He was like unto my father, in a way, and yet was not my father.
61-70968-0006  but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came.
61-70968-0013  Before them fled the stroller and his three sons, Capless and terrified,
61-70968-0021  Surely we can submit with good grace.
61-70968-0028  The head and chief of the riot, the Nottingham Apprentice, with clenched fists threatened Montfichet.
61-70968-0034  Amon Fichet, Amon Fichet, game well to the rescue!
61-70968-0040  Right willingly, for between us we have won the battle, answered Robin.
61-70968-0047  Master Monceau, the sheriff of Nottingham, was mightily put about when told of the rioting.
61-70968-0053  He is my Esquire Excellency, returned Robin with dignity.
61-70968-0056  The wine did certainly bring back the color to the squire's cheeks.
61-70968-0059  It'll be no disappointment to me.
61-70970-0000  Young Fitzuth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the squire.
61-70970-0002  Most of all, Robin thought of his father. What would he counsel?
61-70970-0009  tis late, and I go myself within a short space.
61-70970-0014  Presently, he crossed the floor of his room with decided step.
61-70970-0016  We will go out together to the bower. There is a way down to the court from my window.
61-70970-0024  They moved thereafter cautiously about the hut, groping before and about them to find something to show that the warrant had fulfilled his mission.
61-70970-0026  Fitzuth's hand rested at last upon the top rung of a ladder, and slowly the truth came to him.
61-70970-0029  From the blackness behind the light they heard a voice. Warrantons.
61-70970-0030  Save me, masters, but you startled me rarely.
61-70970-0035  Warrenton spoke thus with significance to show Robin that he was not to think Jeffrey's claims to the estate would be passed by.
61-70970-0038  The old servant told him quietly as they crept back to Gamewell that this passageway led from the hut in the Pleasants to Sherwood, and that Jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest.
672-122797-0005  Oh, that made him so angry.
672-122797-0007  In autumn, the woodcutters always came and felled some of the largest trees.
672-122797-0010  Rejoice in thy growth," said the sunbeams.
672-122797-0016  Yes, and something better, something still Grander will surely follow. Or wherefore should they thus ornament me?
672-122797-0017  Something better, something still grander must follow, but what?
672-122797-0018  Rejoice in our presence, said the air and the sunlight.
672-122797-0019  Rejoice in my own fresh youth!
672-122797-0027  The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated it.
672-122797-0032  cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.
672-122797-0034  A story!" cried the children, drawing a little fat man towards the tree.
672-122797-0035  But I shall tell only one story.
672-122797-0038  thought the fir tree, and believed it all, because the man who told the story was so good-looking.
672-122797-0047  How kind man is, after all.
672-122797-0050  They snuffed about the fir tree and rustled among the branches.
672-122797-0056  said the fir tree, thinking over what he had himself related.
672-122797-0062  No, said the tree.
672-122797-0064  At last the little mice stayed away also, and the tree sighed. After all, it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listened to what I told them.
672-122797-0067  The trunks were moved, the tree was pulled out and thrown. Rather hard it is true, down on the floor. But a man drew him towards the stairs, where the daylight shone.
6829-68769-0000  Kenneth and Beth refrained from telling the other girls or Uncle John of Old Will Rogers' visit, but they got Mr. Watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check.
6829-68769-0001  It was a serious crime indeed, Mr. Watson told them, and Tom Gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in the State's prison as a consequence of his rash act.
6829-68769-0013  Maybe see Gates at once, ask Kenneth.
6829-68769-0015  Sometimes, I'm that yearning for a smoke, I'm nearly crazy, and I don't know which is worse, dying one way or the other.
6829-68769-0041  I'm not electioneering just now.
6829-68769-0045  I'll pay all the cost besides.
6829-68769-0046  You're foolish. Why should you do all this?
6829-68769-0048  Give me a check for 150, and I'll turn over to you the Forge check and quash further proceedings.
6829-68769-0052  He might have had that forged check for the face of it if he'd been sharp
6829-68769-0053  and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of $150.
6829-68771-0002  the weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified, and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from the opposition.
6829-68771-0005  The only thing necessary was to fix Seth Reynolds, and this Hopkins arranged personally.
6829-68771-0006  And this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy.
6829-68771-0021  But it can't be, protested the girl.
6829-68771-0023  You speak like an educated person, said Beth, wonderingly. Where is your home?
6829-68771-0033  She rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath.
6829-68771-0035  Will you leave me alone in my own room or must I go away to escape you?
6829-68771-0036  Eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam, and a key clicked in the lock.
6930-75918-0001  The English voted to the French baskets of flowers of which they had made a plentiful provision to greet the arrival of the young princess. The French, in return, invited the English to a supper, which was to be given the next day.
6930-75918-0005  The Count had thrown himself back on his seat, leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus, his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and restless limbs.
6930-75918-0014  But, continued Rao, not interrupted by this movement of his friend, heaven be praised, the French, who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet, reckless even, are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bear on matters of such high importance.
6930-75918-0020  Bragalon watched for some time the conduct of the two lovers listen to the loud and uncivil slumbers of Manachempe who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold instead of his violet suit.
6930-76324-0000  Goliath makes another discovery.
6930-76324-0006  Hers happened to be on the same frame too, but she evidently didn't care about it.
6930-76324-0008  I thought we were stumped again when I first saw that picture, but it's been of some use after all.
6930-76324-0017  Oh, let him come along, she urged. I do love to see him about that old house.
6930-76324-0018  He makes it sort of cozier.
6930-76324-0025  Why, it's Goliath, as usual, they both cried peering in.
6930-81414-0001  I heard a noise behind. I turned and saw Kaffir, his black eyes shining, while in his hand he held a gleaming knife. He lifted it above his head as if to strike, but I had the strength of ten men, and I hurled him from me.
6930-81414-0014  In the light of the moon I saw a knife red with blood and my hand too was also discolored.
6930-81414-0018  I remembered saying, have we been together?
7021-79730-0002  by reason and affection.
7021-79740-0009  They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.
7021-79740-0012  said she, pointing to the playthings. See?
7021-79740-0014  And this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been.
7021-85628-0000  But Anders cared nothing about that.
7021-85628-0004  Yes, why not, thought Anders?
7021-85628-0008  For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
7021-85628-0011  The princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses and she let Anders sit in a golden chair by her side.
7021-85628-0020  He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
7127-75946-0001  Ah, very well.
7127-75946-0014  The queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dais or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction.
7127-75946-0020  Far from it, Sire. Your Majesty haven't given no directions about it. The musicians have retained it.
7127-75947-0001  Upon this, Madame Dane to turn her eyes languishingly towards the Comte, observing
7127-75947-0005  I allude to the goddess.
7127-75947-0007  She then rose, humming the air to which she was presently going to dance.
7127-75947-0008  The arrow pierced his heart, and wounded him mortally.
7127-75947-0013  I remember now, and I congratulate myself. Do you love anyone?
7127-75947-0014  Forgive me, I hardly know what I am saying. A thousand times forgive me. Madame was right, quite right, this brutal exile has completely turned my brain.
7127-75947-0031  You are positive, then.
7127-75947-0037  Oh, I am speaking seriously, replied Montelet. And my opinion in this case is quite as good as the King's, I suppose. Is it not, Louise?
7176-88083-0007  But such was his keenness that, even while the wide flukes of his engorged victim were still sticking out at the corners of his beak, his fierce red eyes were once more peering downward into the torrent in search of fresh prey.
7176-88083-0008  In despair, he hurled himself downward too soon.
7176-88083-0012  The hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright, motionless as if surprised.
7176-88083-0018  But this frequenture of the heights of air for all his savage valor was troubled at the leaping waves and the tossing foam of these mad rapids. He did not understand them.
7176-88083-0020  where the waves for an instant sank. They came closer, but not quite within grasping reach.
7176-88083-0021  But, as before, the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer, and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam, while doom hung low above his head, yet hesitated to strike.
7176-88083-0026  The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling.
7176-92135-0001  In short, he becomes a prominent figure in London society, and if he is not careful, somebody will say so.
7176-92135-0002  But even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments.
7176-92135-0008  Lend me your ear for 10 minutes and you shall learn just what stagecraft is.
7176-92135-0016  This would be an easy way of doing it, but it would not be the best way, for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself.
7176-92135-0024  to be or not to be that is the question whether to his no blur
7176-92135-0029  I want to get away from it all. Swoon.
7176-92135-0031  And there you are. You will of course appreciate that the unfinished instances not only save time, but also make the maneuvering very much more natural.
7176-92135-0033  relapses into science for the rest of the evening.
7176-92135-0038  A stage meal is popular because it proved to the audience that the actors, even one called Charles Hultry or Owen Nair's, are real people just like you and me.
7176-92135-0039  Tea, please, Matthews. Butler, impassively.
7729-102255-0000  The bogus legislature numbered 36 members.
7729-102255-0005  This was a formable array of advantages. Slavery was playing with loaded dice.
7729-102255-0006  Coming by way of the Missouri River towns, he fell first among border ruffian companionship and influences, and perhaps having his inclinations already molded by his Washington instructions, his early impressions were decidedly adverse to the Free State cause.
7729-102255-0008  All the territorial dignitaries were present. Governor Shannon presided. John Calhoun, the surveyor general, made the principal speech, a denunciation of the abolitionist, supporting the Topeka movement. Chief Justice Lacombe dignified the occasion with approving remarks.
7729-102255-0021  But the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the Free State men were insurrectionists and outlaws.
7729-102255-0038  Atchison, who had been haranguing the mob, planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it.
8224-274381-0008  With these and some reinforcements of the Atholmen and McDonald's whom he had recalled, Montrose fell suddenly upon Argyle's country, and let loose upon it all the rage of war, carrying off the cattle, burning the houses, and putting the inhabitants to the sword.
8224-274381-0010  By a quick and unexpected march, Montrose hastened to Ineloki, and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised, but not a frightened, Covenanters.
8224-274381-0012  Montrose, weak in cavalry, here lined his troops of horse with infantry, and after putting the enemy's horse to rout, fell with united force upon their foot, who were entirely cut in pieces, though with the loss of the gallant Lord Gordon on the part of the royalists.
8224-274381-0014  Besides members of parliament who were excluded, many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions, and then warily facilitated the project of putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction.
8224-274381-0015  Though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible, a more exact plan was introduced, and rigorously executed by these new commanders.
8224-274384-0000  He passed through Henley, St Albans, and came so near to London as Harrow on the Hill.
8224-274384-0006  The king stood up and called for that psalm which begins with these words.
8230-279154-0000  The analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the 13th lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise.
8230-279154-0005  All that I am doing is to use its logical tuneability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember.
8230-279154-0007  Habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times. If the behaviorist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit, that can only be because he trusts his memory, when it assures him that there have been other times.
8230-279154-0011  Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar while others feel strange.
8230-279154-0018  There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events.
8230-279154-0019  It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present, but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events.
8230-279154-0027  A gramophone, by the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidents of its past, and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe.
8230-279154-0031  They give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds, but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences, which is what constitutes knowledge memory.
8230-279154-0036  A further stage is recognition.
8230-279154-0042  Thus, if I recognize a thing, the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which I recognize it forms part of my experience by definition. Recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world.
8455-210777-0000  I remained there alone for many hours, but I must acknowledge that before I left the chambers, I had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light.
8455-210777-0014  Sir Kennington Oval is a very fine player, said my wife.
8455-210777-0018  This, she said, was true hospitality. And I am not sure that I did not agree with that.
8455-210777-0019  Then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies.
8455-210777-0031  You have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in England stands so high.
8455-210777-0032  It is a duty, said I.
8455-210777-0033  But your power is so superior to any that I can advance, as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it.
8455-210777-0036  I can afford to smile because I am absolutely powerless before you. But I do not, the less, feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned, I, or rather we, have been put down by brute force.
8455-210777-0043  But what is the delicate mission?" I asked.
8455-210777-0046  You may be quite sure it's there, said Captain Battleaxe, and that I can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board.
8455-210777-0050  One of us always remains on board while the other is on shore.
8455-210777-0052  You will allow me to suggest, said he, that that is a matter of opinion.
8455-210777-0058  It is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work.
8455-210777-0064  And I have no one ready to whom I can give up the archives of the government.
8463-287645-0006  The doctor who attended the injured creature in this case was simply told that she slipped and fell down the stairs as she was coming down.
8463-287645-0007  Another case, said John Wesley, was a little girl, half-grown, who was washing windows upstairs one day, and, unluckily, fell asleep in the window, and in this position was found by her mistress. In a rage, the mistress hid her a heavy slap, knocked her out of the window, and she fell to the pavement, and died in a few hours from the effects thereof.
8463-287645-0011  She was a large, homely woman. They were common white people with no reputation in the community.
8463-294825-0000  It's almost beyond conjecture.
8463-294825-0002  First as a Paris stockbroker, later as a celebrated author and yachtsman, he went on frequent voyages to Britain, America, the Mediterranean.
8463-294828-0011  He went here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment.
8463-294828-0012  Please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting that I had turned forty.
8463-294828-0015  Conce, I called a third time. Conce appeared.
8463-294828-0025  but we're going just the same.
8463-294828-0028  I opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the Barbarossa and Conce at my heels, I jumped into a carriage.
8463-294828-0030  I asked for Commander Farragut.
8463-294828-0033  I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's mess.
8463-294828-0035  And so, if I had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less, the frigate would have gone without me, and I would have missed out on this unearthly, extraordinary, and inconceivable expedition, whose true story might well meet with some skepticism.
8555-284447-0000  Then he rushed downstairs into the courtyard, shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch everybody and his dominions that the sailor man was not recaptured.
8555-284447-0005  The room of the Great Knife was high and big, and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon.
8555-284447-0012  The captain shook his head.
8555-284447-0014  The idea of patching cat and bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him. And the more he thought of it, the more he roared with laughter.
8555-284447-0023  I couldn't shiver much being bound so tight, but when I'm loose I mean to have just one good shiver to relieve my feelings.
8555-284449-0001  Then they all marched out a little way into the fields, and found that the army of pinkies had already formed, and was advancing steadily toward them.
8555-284449-0002  At the head of the pinkies were Getka Sizzle and Button Bright, who had the parrot on his shoulder, and they were supported by Captain Coralie and Captain Tintent and Rosalie the Witch.
8555-284449-0006  Don't worry, sizzle deer, it'll all come right pretty soon.
8555-284449-0012  I'll gladly do that, promised the new Bularoo, and I'll feed the honorable Godal the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat, besides the grass.
8555-284449-0015  I'll not be wicked anymore, sighed the old Boolaroo. I'll reform.
8555-284449-0017  When first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever, but the blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them, for there was not a single person in all the blue country who loved the princess as the least little bit.
8555-292519-0001  Guided by you, how we might stroll towards death, our only music one another's breath, through gardens intimate with hollyhocks, where silent poppies burn between the rocks, by pools where birches bend to confidants above green waters scummed with lily plants.
908-157963-0008  Thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks, For thou shall be clothed in light and fed with morning manna, Till summer's heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs To flourish in eternal veils. They, why should thou complain,
908-157963-0010  She ceased and smiled in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine.
908-157963-0012  But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun. I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place?
908-157963-0014  Descend, O little cloud, and hover before the eyes of Thel.
908-157963-0016  I pass away, yet I complain, and no one hears my voice.
908-157963-0030  Why an ear, a whirlpool, fears to draw creations in?
908-31957-0000  All is said without a word.
908-31957-0007  Could it mean to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow?
908-31957-0012  If he, to keep one oath, must lose one joy, by his life's star foretold.
908-31957-0014  A ring of amethyst I could not wear here, plainer to my sight, than that first kiss.
908-31957-0015  That was the chrism of love, which loves own crown, with sanctifying sweetness did proceed the third upon my lips was folded down in perfect purple state. Since when, indeed, I have been proud and said, my love, my own.
908-31957-0020  I thank all who have loved me in their hearts, with thanks and love from mine.
